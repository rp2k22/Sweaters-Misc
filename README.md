# Sweaters-Misc
Files I've made in putting together my sweater program (Which itself will have its own repository.). I'm partly using this to host / share files rather than version control, so if there's something sweater-related you're looking for that's not my sweater program itself, you're in the right place I bet.

  GeneratingSweaterPatterns1.xlsx
This was my first take at generating sweater patterns! I started with Excel because I'm an IOE and my brain sort of works in Excel. It works pretty well, I made two sweaters with it that turned out fine, but it became pretty clear that I was running into Excel's limitations. A solid proof of concept that I learned a lot from and has informed my later work!
